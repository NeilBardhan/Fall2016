#Information Visualization

**This repository contains graphs, charts and visualizations that I have designed using d3js. All of the data has been sourced from public sources. Some of the designs have been inspired by examples that I come across. I will reference them wherever I reuse/recreate them.**

##1. Educational Attainment for USA

I visualize the educational attainment state by state using data from the [US Census](http://www.census.gov/hhes/socdemo/education/). The **barplots** show the statewide educational attainment statistics for people with *High School*, *Bachelor's* or *Advanced* degrees for the year of 2009. The **choropleth** map shows a timeline of these statistics and how they have changed from 1990-2009.

##2. India Statewide Fact File

I use an interactive map of India to present state by state facts like **State Capital**, **Population**, **Population Density** and **Sex Ratio** with data sourced from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_union_territories_of_India_by_population)
