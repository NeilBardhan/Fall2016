#Information Visualization

**This repository contains graphs, charts and visualizations that I have designed using d3js. All of the data has been sourced from public sources. Some of the designs have been inspired by examples that I come across. I will reference them wherever I reuse/recreate them.**

##1. Educational Attainment for USA

I visualize the educational attainment state by state using data from the US Census. The **barplots** show the latest statewide educational attainment statistics for people with *High School*, *Bachelor's* or *Advanced* degrees. The **choropleth** map shows a timeline of these statistics and how they have changed from 1990 onwards.

##2. India Statewide Fact File

I use an interactive map of India to present state by state facts like **State Capital**, **Population**, **Population Density** and **Sex Ratio**.
